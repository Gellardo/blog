I have read a lot about how Wasm is great for porting non-JS languages into the browser and maybe even into a general Lambda runtime.
Also better security and ability to compile libraries into Wasm and use them in other languages.
So I wanted to try it and document my experience using Rust+Wasm to build a game of life using wasm (before knowing about the book).

**TLDR:** Read the [official rustwasm book](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/) instead of reading about me stumbling around.

## Baby steps: Setting up from a template
## Implement rust logic
## It's alive: Visualization in the browser
## What I understood of wasm-pack
## Can I get rid of manual JS completely?
## It's really performant, right?
## What's next
No clue.
